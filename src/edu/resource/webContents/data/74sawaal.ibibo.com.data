If technology touches your life, chances are, so does Java technology. Invented by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java technology has become the essential ingredient of the digital experience for hundreds of millions of people in all walks of life, all over the planet.
Java software powers the onboard computers in toys, cars, planes, rockets, and even the NASA Mars Rover. It brings interactivity to the Internet, real-time graphics to television, instant imaging to cameras, and multi-player games to mobile phones and desktop PCs. It connects the largest enterprises and smallest businesses to their employees, customers, and data. And it secures the vast majority of electronic transactions in retail, finance, government, science, and medicine. In short, Java technology goes everywhere you go.
It's no wonder that Java technology has become the most powerful force in software and the most prevalent software in technology. In fact, it is the software of choice for more software engineers than any other brand of software.
If you're looking for a way to do something that's never been done before, and you want the most thrilling, efficient, fast, secure, animated, compatible, and reliable software for the job, you've come to the right place.
